## What is Rubber Duck & Bad Usb
<hr/>

#### So basically bad usb is a seemingly normal usb but it has a processor inside it. In that way the user can able to execute any code just in seconds do whatever he/she wants like closing the windows defender system, enjecting the virus, creating a backdoor and more it's up to your imagination. And in this repository i used the language called Ducky Script which i'll explain in the other section

<br/>

## Rubber Duck
<hr>

#### Rubber Ducky is a typical bad usb which is produced by Hak5. It has a own programming language called Ducky Script but don't worry I can easily say that it's the simplest programming language i have ever seen.

## Ducky Script
<hr>

#### Ducky Script is a language that Hak5 created for Rubber Duck and its the simplest language that you can learn because there is no variable types, loops or even if else statements. Bad usb is based on controlling the victim's keyboard and type things in miliseconds. And since its based on controlling the keyboard the Ducky Script language is just needs to know what key user wanna press and how much time it got to wait to execute the next code. Let me show you an example:
<br/>

#### So if you wanna make program to open windows start menu you should make it to press ctrl and ESC at the same time and to do that you just write a line like `CTRL ESC` in Ducky Script. In another example if you need to press tab and then enter you just need to write `TAB` and `ENTER` in the next line, its simple as that!
